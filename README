Apache2-Authen-OdinAuth -- A cookie-based single sign-on system for Apache

This is a rewrite of GodAuth mod_perl single sign-on script
(http://github.com/exflickr/GodAuth), packaged as a proper CPAN
module, with easier setup, and a Perl Dancer authorizer webapp

https://github.com/ginzamarkets/App-OdinAuthorizer, and more details

module itself is being developed at
https://github.com/ginzamarkets/Apache2-Authen-OdinAuth/.
